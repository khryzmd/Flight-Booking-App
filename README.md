### Use Cases
- **Use Case 1**: User Registration
  - **Title**: User Registration
  - **Description**: Allows users to create an account using their email or social media accounts.
  - **Actors**: User
  - **Preconditions**: User accesses the registration page.
  - **Postconditions**: User account is successfully created.
  - **Main Flow**:

    2. User enters their registration details (name, email, password).
    3. System validates the entered data.
    4. User selects registration method (email or social media).
    5. System verifies user information.
    6. User account is created and a confirmation email is sent.
  - **Alternate Flows**: 
    - If the user chooses social media registration, skip the email verification step.

- **Use Case 2**: Flight Search and Booking

  - **Actors**: User, System
  - **Preconditions**: User is logged in.
  - **Postconditions**: Booking confirmation is sent to the user.
  - **Main Flow**: 
    1. User enters search criteria (origin, destination, dates).
    2. System queries the flight database based on the entered criteria.
    3. System displays available flights matching the search criteria.
    4. User selects a desired flight.
    5. System confirms the booking and reserves seats.
    6. Booking confirmation and details are sent to the user via email.
  - **Alternate Flows**: 
    - If no flights are available for the entered criteria, notify the user and suggest alternatives.

### System Features
