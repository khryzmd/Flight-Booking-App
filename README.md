- **Use Case 2**: Flight Search
  - **Title**: Flight Search
  - **Description**: Users can search for flights based on criteria like destination, dates, and number of passengers.
  - **Actors**: User, System
  - **Preconditions**: User is logged into the system.
  - **Postconditions**: Available flights matching search criteria are displayed.
  - **Main Flow**: 
    1. User enters flight search criteria (origin, destination, dates, number of passengers).
    2. System queries the flight database based on the entered criteria.
    3. System displays a list of available flights that match the search criteria, including flight details (price, duration, layovers).

  - **Alternate Flows**: 
    - If no flights match the entered criteria, notify the user and suggest alternative dates or destinations.

- **Use Case 3**: Booking Management
  - **Title**: Booking Management
  - **Description**: Users can view and manage their bookings, including cancellations and changes.
  - **Actors**: User, System
  - **Preconditions**: User is logged into the system and has bookings.
  - **Postconditions**: Booking changes (cancellations, modifications) are successfully processed.
  - **Main Flow**: 
    1. User accesses their booking management section.
    2. System retrieves and displays the user's current bookings.
    3. User selects a booking to manage (cancel or modify).
    4. System processes the requested action (cancellation or modification).
    5. Confirmation of booking change is sent to the user via email.
  - **Alternate Flows**: 
    - Handle scenarios where cancellations or modifications are not allowed based on booking rules or timing.

- **Use Case 4**: Payment Processing
  - **Title**: Payment Processing
  - **Description**: Secure payment gateway integration for ticket purchases.
  - **Actors**: Payment Gateway, System
  - **Preconditions**: User has selected a flight and confirmed booking details.
  - **Postconditions**: Payment is successfully processed, and booking is confirmed.
  - **Main Flow**: 
    1. User selects payment method (credit/debit card, digital wallet).
    2. User enters payment details securely.
    3. System validates payment information and initiates payment through the selected payment gateway.
    4. Payment gateway processes the payment securely.
    5. System updates booking status to "confirmed" and generates a booking confirmation and itinerary.
    6. Booking confirmation and e-ticket are sent to the user via email.
  - **Alternate Flows**: 
    - If payment fails, notify the user and provide options to retry payment or choose a different payment method.
